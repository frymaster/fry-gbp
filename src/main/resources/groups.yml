#Definition and permissions for the groups

#First, the meta-groups
#These cannot be removed, and you can't define their membership
#Everyone is in "all", and all ops are in "op"

#Priority determines what order permissions are evaluated in
#Lower numbers are evaluated first.  Whichever group gets the last word, wins
#It probably makes sense to give the meta-groups low priority, so your more specific
#groups can override
#If two groups have the same priority behaviour is NOT guaranteed
#If a priority is not specified, 0 will be used

all:
  permissions:
  priority: 50
  
ops:
  permissions:
  priority: 60
  
#Use "inherit" to include permissions from another group
#Set "default: true" to make a default group
#Users are considered members of a default group if they are members of the group
#OR if they are not explicit members of any group

#file sets the filename to use for storing memberships.  You don't need this if
#  the group is only used for defaults or inheriting
#Examples:

#guests:
#  default: true
#  priority: 100
#  permissions:
#    - -someProtectionPlugin.build

#members:
#  priority: 110
#  file: members.txt
#  permissions:
#    - someTeleportPlugin.tp
#    - -somePlugin.modPermission

#mods:
#  priority: 120
#  file: mods.txt
#  inherit: members
#  permissions:
#    - bukkit.command.kick
#    - somePlugin.modPermission
